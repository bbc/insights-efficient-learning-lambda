Backend system to support the Quizzes feature in BBC Bitesize

The following documentation is available:

-   [Development Environment](./devdocs/DevelopmentEnvironment.md)
-   [Continuous Deployment](./devdocs/ContinuousDeployment.md)
-   [Infrastructure](./devdocs/Infrastructure.md)

## PreRequisites

### Python 3

To install Python 3 visit https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ for instructions.

### Pip

This is the python package manager and is needed to install virtualenv and other Python packages:

Instructions on how to do this can be found here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

### VirtualEnv

VirtualEnv is a virtual environment manager for Python that allows packages to be installed in isolated environments.

You should be able to install this using pip/pip3 install virtualenv

### Docker

Docker is an application that runs containers on your macOS machines.
Instructions on how to install Docker can be found here : https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

### AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool that provides a consistent interface for interacting with all parts of AWS. AWS CLI commands for different services are covered in the accompanying user guide, including descriptions, syntax, and usage examples.
Instructions on how to install AWS CLI can be found here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html

### AWS SAM CLI

SAM is used to build and run the lambda locally. Sam can be used for other tasks such as deployment however we will not be using it for this purpose.
Instructions on how to install SAM can be found here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html

### Configuring AWS Credentials

Create a file `~/.curlrc` in your home path i.e, `~/`. In the file add the following parameters
replacing ACCOUNT_NUMBER with your AWS environment wormhole number. This process saves you time
regenerating credentials for login. Similalry replace key and cert options with your dev cert paths
accordingly. Hint: These are same certs used for morph development.

```
url="https://wormhole.api.bbci.co.uk/account/ACCOUNT_NUMBER/credentials"
key = "/etc/pki/certificate.pem"
cert = "/etc/pki/certificate.pem"
```

then run the following:

```
$ ./scripts/aws-configuration.sh
```

Your credentials should now be configured and the path to it is ~/.aws/credentials

## Getting Started

There is a Makefile which shows all available tasks which can be executed for this lambda including testing and linting.

Before doing anything, the dependecies must be installed using virtualenv

```
$ make venv
```

This should generate a `venv/` directory in the root.

### Running the Lambda

```
$ make build-lambda
$ make run-lambda
```

This should show the lambda being invoked liked so:

## Testing

Before doing anything, the dependecies must be installed using virtualenv

```
$ make venv
```

Run the Unit Tests via

```
$ make test
```
